# My Personal Passion Project
For this Project I get 1 month to make something for a client of your chose to fullfill a tool they can use in real life. The client can be yourself or a real client where you make something for them they can use in real life. The way this has to be made are with everything wee learned in the past 3 years and with minimum 1 thing you explore yourself so you show you can follow the fast changing technological world.

## Who is the client?
The client is everyone who wants to have fun with friends when they are bored. You can do this local and from a different place. Crossplay isn't a problem, Android & iOS will be able to play together

## Core Project Statement
The game I am going to make is a AR Multiplayer Pictionary game where you can have a 3D Image that the drawer draws in the space he scanned and is also visible for you in your local AR space

## Deliverables
The game is made with Unity, this is a completely new environment for me. The development happens in C# and for the multiplayer I use PUN2
