# My Personal Passion Project
For this Project I get 1 month to make something for a client of your chose to fullfill a tool they can use in real life. The client can be yourself or a real client where you make something for them they can use in real life. The way this has to be made are with everything wee learned in the past 3 years and with minimum 1 thing you explore yourself so you show you can follow the fast changing technological world.

## Who is the client?
The client is everyone who wants to have fun with friends when they are bored. You can do this local and from a different place. Crossplay isn't a problem, Mobile Tablet or Desktop will be able to play together

## Core Project Statement
Its a lookalike from pictionary, the people can enter a lobby or make one to play with friends. You have to draw what the computer tells you to draw and the others need to guess it. The person that reaches the set goal by the host will win the game.

## Deliverables
The game will be made in React, for the canvas to make sketches on we will use the p5.js library. Driven with socket.io you will get the real feeling of playing a stable game that is really responsive on what you do so everything is almost _(a-)_ live _(-and kicking)_.
